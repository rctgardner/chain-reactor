# Chain Reactor

Chain Reactor is an open-source tool for testing detection and response
coverage on Linux machines. The tool generates executables that simulate
sequences of actions like process creation and network connection. Chain Reactor
assumes no prior engineering experience; the tool consumes JSON, so customizing
its behavior is as simple as editing a file.
